# library App Front-end

This code sources are for the frontend-app of this app

## How should this be tested

- Open the project and in the terminal at the root folder, run `yarn install`
- After the node-modules have installed, open `.env.example` and create and copy their content into a `.env` file.
- Fill all those environment variables with their correct values
- Finally, run `yarn dev` to start app in development mode
